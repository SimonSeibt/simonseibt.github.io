I am a Research Assistant in the [Game Tech Lab](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/fakultaeten/in/forschung/game-tech-labor/) at the Nuremberg Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Würzburg under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bartosz von Rymon Lipinski](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/person/von-rymon-lipinski-bartosz/) (Game Tech Lab, Nuremberg Institute of Technology) and [Prof. Dr. Marc Erich Latoschik](https://hci.uni-wuerzburg.de/people/marc/) ([Human Computer Interaction Group](https://hci.uni-wuerzburg.de), University of Würzburg). With my cooperative doctorate, I am a member of the Bavarian Academic Forum ([BayWISS Joint Academic Partnership Digitalisation](https://digitalisierung.baywiss.de/en/)). 

My research interests are in computer vision and image-based rendering. My current research focuses on (a) non-real-time computer vision applications that rely on accurate and robust feature matching, in particular of image pairs with a high depth complexity, and (b) the preprocessing and visualization of interactive image-based 3D scenes (see e.g. our current [joint research project]({% post_url 2023-04-29-iDZ-2025 %}) in the context of Industry 4.0).

I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science in 2016 and my M.Sc. in Computer Science with the focus on (alternative) 3D real-time rendering methods in 2018, both at the Nuremberg Institute of Technology.
